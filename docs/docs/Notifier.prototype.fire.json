Typically this is gleaned from the\nDOMEventFacade or EventFacade, but if configured with emitFacade=false, an\nobject must be provided.  In that case, the object will be removed from the\ncallback parameters.</p>\n\n<p>Additional arguments passed during event subscription will be\nautomatically added after those passed to fire().</p>", "comment": "undefined@method fire\n@private\n", "params": [{"name": "e", "description": "<p>{EventFacade|DOMEventFacade|Object|any} (see description)</p>"}, {"name": "arg*", "description": "<p>{any} additional arguments received by all subscriptions</p>"}], "src": "can/lib/yui-3.7.3.js", "line": 19279})
