This tutorial will walk you though the basics of CanJS by building a small
to-do app with CanJS and jQuery.

To get started, click [Constructs Constructs] in the navigation to the left. Or, if this
tutorial isn't your thing, or if you prefer to watch, try the [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=GdT4Oq6ZQ68) tutorial instead. Also, take a look around and see some nifty [Recipes recipes] for building functionality with CanJS, check out
our [API](../docs/index.html), or dive right in and poke around the [annotated source](http://canjs.com/release/latest/docs/can.jquery.html) for CanJS.
